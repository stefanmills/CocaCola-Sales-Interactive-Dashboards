Data Cleaning:

The dataset has been pre-cleaned, so you only need to press CTRL+T to convert it into a table.
Creating Pivot Tables:

Next, generate a pivot table with the following metrics: Total Revenue, Total Units Sold, Profit, and Average Operating Profit.
Dashboard Header:

On the dashboard, establish a header and connect the values from the pivot table to their respective column names.
Invoice Date Analysis:

Create another pivot table to focus on Invoice Dates and their corresponding total sales.
Graphical Representation:

Visualize this data graphically using a Bar chart. You can customize the chart by adjusting the bar width and modifying the chart name, among other edits.
Timeline Feature:

Enhance the chart by incorporating a timeline, enabling users to customize and enjoy their data exploration experience.
State Analysis:

Create an additional pivot table to highlight sales data for different states, showcasing the total units sold.
Comparison Table:

Duplicate the data from the state pivot table and display it adjacent to the original pivot table for convenient comparison.
Geographical Representation:

Utilize the map tab to visually display your data on a map, and feel free to make your own customizations to enhance the map's appearance and functionality.
Interactive Slicers:

Implement slicers for brand, region, and retailer, linking them to all pivot tables to provide users with interactive filtering capabilities.
